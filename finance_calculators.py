Notes:
    Since receiving the feedback on task 1 re line lenths i have amended some of
    the lines so that they are less than the limit per pylint

define functions:
    print message
        this was supposed to be standard function for 
        printing calculated message but in the end most
        printing was done in line
    validate_integers 
        a standard routine that checks entry for valid integer in this case greater than 0
    validate_floats
        a standard routine that checks entry for valid float in this case greater than 0
    bond_calculation
        p = pv of house; im = monthly interest rate and n = no of months
        basic forumla = repayment = (i*p)/(1-(1+i)**(-n))
        returns monthly repayment
    interest_calculations
        does both simple and compound calculations
        takes deposit, interest rate and period to save
        simple interest calculator - basic forumla = A = P*(1+r*t)
        compound interest calculator - basic forumla = A=P*math.pow(((1+r),t)
        returns total amount returned and interest earned (4 outputs)

    get choice (main loop)
        validate for valid string lower case and shorten
        q/quit ends
        i/investment for savings
        b/bond for bond

        if investment:

                amount to deposit (int) and validate

                no of years to invest (float) and validate

            ask the user what they want to see
                simple/s
                    show simple int results

                rate of interest (float) and validate
                number of months to repay (int) and validate
                do the calculations using the defined function and calculate return messages
                offer a comparison option
                    does the user want to see the effect of a 1% increase in interest rates
                        if yes
                            calculate new interest rates
                            re-run function
