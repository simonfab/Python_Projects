import libraries
    math

define functions
    get choice
        validate including making allowances for caps etc
        call appropriate function
    Get data and validate
        validate int 
    simple interest return and return message
    compound interest return and return message
    bond/mortgage repayment calculator and return message

    
Set up while loop
    get choice function
    get data input
    print output



collect user option and validate that choice matches an option
if investment:
    ask for inputs of 
    rate of interest (float?)
    no of whole years to invest (int)
    simple or compound return required (could be a boolean but use an int to allow for other options in future)
    do the calculations using the defined funcitons and calculate return messages
    validate inputs especially completeness and greater than 0
    printout the answer - assume - depost, interest earned, and total amt incl interest
    perhaps do a comparison option 
if bond:
    ask for inputs of
    house value (int)
    rate of interest (float?)
    number of months to repay (int)
    validate inputs especially completeness and greater than 0
    do the calculations using the defined function and calculate return messages
    printout the answer - assume - no of months to repay, total repaid, interest paid
    perhaps do a comparison option
print messages
Ask if they want to do another
    Set variable if they want to end
    print thank you for using system
    else carry on and do again
